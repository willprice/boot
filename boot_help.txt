<i>The ideal software tool to write, simulate and synthesize your VHDL code.</i>

Here you can find some help on how to use boot.

<b>How to Install boot</b>
boot runs on Linux and can be easily installed by typing the following commands:

<tt>wget freerangefactory.org/dl/boot</tt>
<tt>chmod +x boot</tt>
<tt>./boot --install</tt>

That's it !

Remember that boot is only one file of few KB in size, it is a good practice to keep 
a copy of it in each of your VHDL projects.

<b>How to use boot</b>
boot is just one file and can be run by simply typing:

<tt>cd /dir_where_boot_is</tt>
<tt>./boot</tt>

Remember that boot expects a <tt>src</tt> folder in the same directory where boot is.
All your VHDL files should be inside the <tt>src</tt> folder. if such a folder does 
not exist, boot will create it.

<b>Compile</b>
This menu allows you to check and compile your VHDL code so that you can move to the
next step which is simulations.
<tt>top-level design file.</tt> This is your VHDL top-level design file.
boot will check your code files every time you save any of them. Use your favorite
editor to edit your code.

To disable the automatic compilation of your code, un-check "auto compile". The 
gree/red check indicates whether your code has been successfully compiled.
