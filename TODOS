# make a button in preference to set things as default. best way is maybe to    DONE
  delete ~/.boot and in some how restart boot.

# fix the problem with the python and environment variables which do not allow  DONE
  the use of the "source" command.

# make a beautify function that colors the synthesis text output as well as the DONE
  compile text output too.

# redesign the synthesis start and stop process handling because it looks like  DONE
  processing power is used when the synthesis is finished.

# redesign the compile semaphore icons and use a progress bar.                  DONE

# add a compile button or bind a return key to it.                              DONE

# add a compile button.

# add a button or text to open the Synthesis Report file counter_top.syr        DONE

# add a progress bar or some way to see that the synthesis process is ongoing.  DONE but Spinner is a little small

# rewrite the beautifier function and make a class instead. In this way it can  DONE 
  be used for both synthesis and compile output window. Also use this new 
  beautifier class to color the boot text editor.

# add save and close button to the txt viewer. In this way the synthesis script DONE
  will be editable by the user.

# find a way to pull the book "free range factory" from the Internet, doing so
  in a new tab might be a little too intrusive.

# find a way to pull vhdl code from opencores.org in a tab. It would be also 
  pretty cool to become able to import opencores code in your src folder.

# modify things so that pip is the default installer.                           DONE

# find a way to let Pip copy the file boot.desktop in /usr/share/applications/  DONE

# change the way new versions of boot are checked and use pip                   DONE

# add a method to get pip to install all boot dependencies via setup.py
