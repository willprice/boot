# make a button in preference to set things as default. best way is maybe to    DONE
  delete ~/.boot and in some how restart boot.

# fix the problem with the python and environment variables which do not allow  DONE
  the use of the "source" command.

# make a beautify function that colors the synthesis text output as well as the DONE
  compile text output too.

# redesign the synthesis start and stop process handling because it looks like  DONE
  processing power is used when the synthesis is finished.

# redesign the compile semaphore icons and use a progress bar.                  DONE

# add a compile button or bind a return key to it.                              DONE

# add a compile and simulate button. For this task I need to rewrite the        DONE
  compile and simulate process.

# write two auto check boxes for Compile and Compile & Simulate tasks           DONE

# add a button or text to open the Synthesis Report file counter_top.syr        DONE

# add a progress bar or some way to see that the synthesis process is ongoing.  DONE

# rewrite the beautifier function and make a class instead. In this way it can  DONE 
  be used for both synthesis and compile output window. Also use this new 
  beautifier class to color the boot text editor.

# add save and close button to the txt viewer. In this way the synthesis script DONE
  will be editable by the user.

# find a way to pull the book "free range factory" from the Internet, doing so  NOT IMPORTANT
  in a new tab might be a little too intrusive.

# find a way to pull vhdl code from opencores.org in a tab. It would be also    DONE
  pretty cool to be able to import opencores code in your src folder.            
  For this task, it would be good to be able to load opencores website and
  find a way customize the way all pages look. No banners, etc. With webkit 
  this should be possible.

# modify things so that pip is the default installer.                           DONE

# find a way to let Pip copy the file boot.desktop in /usr/share/applications/  DONE

# change the way new versions of boot are checked and use pip                   DONE

# add a method to get pip to install all boot dependencies via setup.py         DONE

# fix compiling process now broken and the accelerators of gtkwave now          DONE
  interfering with nano editor.

# make a better icon for boot                                                   DONE

# fix html look on http://opencores.org/project,pcie_sg_dma and also, the 
  cookies between mechanize and webkit are not shared (password is needed twice)

# create a MS Windows version of "boot"
