Standard VHDL headers

Several standard VHDL headers say "all rights reserved". However, these
standard headers are actually not copyrightable because they merely define an
interface, and do NOT fall under any category of copyrightable works as defined
by U.S. Code Title 17 §102(a), and in fact are specifically excluded by
§102(b).
