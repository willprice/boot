<h2>boot</h2>
<p><i>The ideal software tool to write, simulate and synthesize your VHDL code.</i></p>

<p>This software is designed and maintained by <tt>freerangefactory.org</tt>. 
Here you can find some help on how to use boot.</p>

<h3>How to Install boot</h3>
<p>boot runs on Linux and can be easily installed by typing the following commands:</p>

<p><tt>wget freerangefactory.org/dl/boot</tt></p>
<p><tt>chmod +x boot</tt></p>
<p><tt>./boot --build</tt></p>

<p>That's it ! you now have a fully functional version of boot in just 35 kB.
Remember that boot is only one file of few KB in size, it is therefore a good 
practice to keep a copy of it in each of your VHDL project folders.<p>

<h3>How to use boot</h3>
<p>boot is just one file and can be run by simply typing:<p>

<p><tt>./boot</tt><p>

<p>It is recommendable that you keep your VHDL source files in a folder named
<tt>src</tt>. Boot will additionally put all its files inside the folder
<tt>src/build</tt>.</p>

<h3>Compile Tab</h3>
<p>This tab allows you to automatically check and compile your VHDL code. 
Use your favorite editor to edit your code files. 
boot will automatically check and compile your code files every time you modify
and save any file inside the folder you are currently located.</p>

<h4>top-level design file.</h4> 
<p>This is your VHDL top-level design file. This files defines your top-level 
design. The name of this file also implicitly defines your top-level entity.</p>

<p>To disable the automatic compilation of your code, un-check "auto compile". 
The green/red check indicates whether your code has been successfully compiled.</p>
 
<h3>Simulate Tab</h3>
<p>Once your code has being successfully compiled, simulation can take place.
To successfully run a simulation of your project, you need to set your
VHDL test-bench file in the top-level design file entry field.</p>
<p>Your project gets automatically compiled and simulated every time you modify
and save any file inside the folder you are currently located. Please remember
that the name of the test-bench file must also be the name of the top-design 
entity in your project.</p>

<h4>Simulation Time.</h4> 
<p>Here you can select the simulation time. Once you modify this field, the 
simulation can be rerun by simply pressing the return key. Do not forget to
press the Zoom Fit button to see the whole simulation window.</p>

<h4>Synthesize</h4>
<p>This tab allows you to synthesize your code and obtain a <tt>.bin</tt> file that
can be use to program your FPGA. Two synthesis options are available:</p>
<p><b>Local Synthesis.</b> You must have Xilinx ISE installed in your local machine.</p> 
<p><b>Remote Synthesis.</b> Option under development.</p> 
<p>The synthesis is a feature that is currently under development.</p>
