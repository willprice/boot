# Xilinx TCL Flow Example
# try.tcl
# usage: xtclsh try.tcl
# xtclsh is Xilinx tcl shell
# reference: http://www.xilinx.com/itp/xilinx10/books/docs/dev/dev.pdf
# -- details on commandline and tcl command to create and setup project
# http://www.doulos.com/knowhow/tcltk/xilinx/
# -- An good example

# From an existing project, a tcl script can be generated in ISE/project/generate tcl
# It could be usefull as a reference to write my own tcl script, especially to setup process properties.

# Some include file will need to be copied to working directory if they are needed to parse the architecture
# The include file which is included by other include file may need to be copied to working directory??
# Within cygwin terminal, xtclsh works, but from tcsh or xterm, it frozen.

# the following is oen of my example tcl script
# It works with ISE 12.1

if { $argc != 1 } {
puts "The tcl script requires one arguement ."
puts "For example, xtclsh main.tcl my_prj"
puts "Please try again."
} else {
